	<p style='text-align:center'>This product was the final project for my Modeling and Control class in my first semester. Along with Chris Wallace, we created a robot that would follow a black line on a white background. This robot used a photoresistor as a voltage divider. This signal was input into an operational amplifier, which determined whether the robot was on the black or white. The op-amp would then turn the robot left or right. </p>
