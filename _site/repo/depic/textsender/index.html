<h1>TextSender for Pebble Beta</h1>
<h2>Changelog:</h2>
<h3>2.0.0-35</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Hopefully fixed issue with "Action" not showing up in notification menu</li>
    <li>As a workaround in order to make "Action" appear, TextSender for Pebble will clear Pebble's notification sources whenever an app with actionable notifications is added. This means that TextSender will occasionally reset the "Muted" state for certain apps. Apps which you previously had muted will become unmuted occasionally. TextSender will attempt to do this as little as possible.</li>
    <li>Actionable notifications should be functional. Please read the release notes for 2.0.0-1 and 2.0.0-2 before proceeding.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.0.0-2</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I think I fixed the crash after installing the new beta version</li>
    <li>There are a few things you should note about the new notification actions:</li>
    <ul>
    	<li>Pebble may take a long time to launch or freeze up after installing the new beta update. This is somewhat expected, it should work properly after that</li>
    	<li>The "Action" option in the notification menu on your Pebble may not disappear after uninstall, although it will not be functional, and may crash your phone app if the tweak is not installed. The "Action" option may remain even if you remove the tweak or if you restore your phone.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h3>2.0.0-1</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Reply to actionable notifications with your Pebble! To perform a notification action, choose "Action" from the notifications menu. If a notification doesn't have any actions, or those actions would require you to unlock your phone, only a "Dismiss" action will be shown. You may only be able to perform an action on a notification one time. Please, please, give me any feedback or let me know of any issues that you find.</strong></li>
