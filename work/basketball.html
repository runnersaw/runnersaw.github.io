	<p style='text-align:center'>This product was the final project for my Physics: A Theoretical Approach class in my second semester. I created a detailed simulation of a basketball's path. This simulation included factors such as gravity and air resistance. The model also accounted for spin's effect upon the collisions, and was able to simulate a shot from any point in three dimensions with any speed and spin. From there, I varied the parameters over shot distances, and added human error. By running the simulation about one million times, I was able to derive a theoretical best shot. </p>
