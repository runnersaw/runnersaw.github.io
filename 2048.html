	<p style='text-align:center'>This is a project that I worked on in the summer of 2014. It started with the initial idea of creating an AI for 2048. After building the game and completing the AI, I put work into improving the AI. Then I realized that I could do something that I hadn't yet seen on the internet: I could make a framework for the user to play against the AI. Using Flask, I created a 2048 web app where the user could play against the computer. I also optimized the site for mobile, creating an HTML-based mobile app. The game can be found <a href="http://vs-2048.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">here</a>. Please visit on your phone also. </p>
