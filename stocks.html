	<p>This product was the final project for my Software Design class in my second semester. Along with Griffin Tschurwald, Greg Coleman, Kevin Suzuki, and Maor Bernstein, we created a web app that would predict stock prices. This web app, created with Flask and Python, databased stocks with SQL, pulled tweets from Twitter with the Pattern module, and analyzed the stock's prices using multivariable linear ridge regression. </p>
