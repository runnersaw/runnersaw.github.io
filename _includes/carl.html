<h4>Carl is a line following robot. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-wallace-a9580281">Chris Wallace</a> and I designed and built the robot after our first semester Modeling and Controls class. The robot, built with op-amps, DC motors, a photoresistor, and Legos, uses the photoresistor in a voltage divider that is an input to the op-amp. Whenever the car is over white, it turns left, and when over black, it turns right. </h4>
