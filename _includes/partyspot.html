<h4>PartySpot is an Android application devloped to enable users to collaborate on their music playlists. The application enables the hosts of a party to create a playlist. PartySpot synchronizes their music playback so that music throughout the house is playing at the same time, on the same song. Guests can suggest songs, which the host can easily add to the playlist.
