    PartySpot is an Android application devloped to enable users to collaborate on their music playlists.
    <br><br>
    PartySpot synchronizes the playlist's playback across multiple devices so that music throughout the house is playing at the same time, on the same song.
    Guests can also suggest and upvote/downvote songs, which the host can easily add to the playlist.
    <br><br>
    The app was built in Java using the Spotify SDK.
