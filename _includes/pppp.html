<p class="project-full-description">For our Principles of Engineering course, my team built a machine that would take images and draw them on a sheet of paper with a Sharpie. Our machine won an Honorable Mention in the <a href='http://robotart.org' target='_blank' rel="noopener">2016 Robot Art competition</a>. The machine consisted of a platter spun at a constant speed, a gantry over the platter which contained the marker assembly, and the electronics to control the whole system. The computer would take an input image, binarize it, and convert it to a list of commands for the Arduino. The Arduino measures the location of the platter, and controls the radial distance of the marker, and it's up/down state. The project is documented on our website <a href='http://poepolarprintingpress.weebly.com' target='_blank' rel="noopener">here</a>. You can see images that it's drawn and a video of it drawing in 'Gallery'.</p>
