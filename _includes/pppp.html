<p class="project-full-description">
    For our Principles of Engineering course, my team built a machine that would take images and draw them on a sheet of paper with a Sharpie.
    Our machine won an Honorable Mention in the <a href='http://robotart.org' target='_blank' rel="noopener">2016 Robot Art competition</a>.
    <br><br>
    The machine consisted of a platter spun at a constant speed, a gantry over the platter which contained the marker assembly, and the electronics to control the whole system.
    The computer would take an input image, binarize it, and convert it to a list of commands for the Arduino.
    The Arduino measures the location of the platter, and controls the radial distance of the marker, and it's up/down state.
    <br><br>
    The image processing is written in Python, while the device actuation controls are written in Arduino.

    <a href='http://poepolarprintingpress.weebly.com/code.html' target='_blank' rel="noopener">The project is documented on our website</a>. You can see images that it's drawn and a video of it drawing in 'Gallery'.
