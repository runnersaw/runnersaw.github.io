<h3 class="about-text rockyregular">
	Rocky Mountain News reporter Kevin Vaughan was named a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in feature writing Monday, for his 34-part series recounting the 1961 bus crash that killed 20 children near Greeley.
	<br /><br />
	Vaughan, 44, said he was "excited and humbled" by the honor, considered journalism<span class="quote">'</span>s highest prize.
	<br /><br />
	"I<span class="quote">'</span>ll always be grateful to the families who lived through the tragedy of Dec. 14, 1961, and shared their story with our readers," he said.
	<br /><br />
	The Denver Post also was named a finalist for investigative reporting, for its series on the destruction of evidence in criminal cases.
	<br /><br />
	"The Crossing" told the stories of those who died and the 17 survivors after a train slammed into a school bus. It also explored the impact that single moment had on hundreds of lives, even 45 years later.
	<br /><br />
	As the narrative unfolded in early 2007, Vaughan heard from more than 1,000 readers. In August, a memorial was erected near the crash site, using money raised by family members of some of the victims.
	<br /><br />
	The Washington Post won the feature writing Pulitzer. The other finalist was from the Los Angeles Times. In investigative reporting, the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune won.
	<br /><br />
	Vaughan has worked for the Rocky for 10 years. He collaborated on The Crossing with Rocky photographer Chris Schneider.
