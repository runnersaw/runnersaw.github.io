			<p>Sometimes the most surprising thing about a tragedy is not what it does to people, but what it doesn't do to them.</p>
<p>For three kids pummeled inside their school bus by a high-speed passenger train in 1961, the legacy of the accident is remarkably similar, even though their injuries were decidedly different.</p>
<p>It happened. They recovered. It didn't dramatically alter their lives. One came away with little more than a lost boot, some bruises and scrapes. Another suffered a broken back, but it hasn't slowed him down a bit.</p>
<p>The third &mdash; miraculously, the only child in the very back of the bus who survived the collision &mdash; almost died and suffered through an excruciating recovery, but, like the others, went on to live a full life.</p>
<p>When they think about that day, they are philosophical. No bad feelings come. When they talk about that day, they are composed.</p>
<p>They don't cry.</p>
<p><b>Jumbled memories</b></p>
<p>Randy Geisick wanted to do something special.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes earlier, the 8-year-old had climbed onto his school bus, carrying Christmas paper to wrap a gift he had made in class.</p>
<p>He woke up in the shattered remains of the bus, his left boot gone, his foot freezing. As he worked his way free and stepped out into the chaotic scene, a Union Pacific train sat idling down the tracks.</p>
<p>Someone &mdash; he is not sure who &mdash; stood on one of the rails, balancing. Randy was worried about him.</p>
<p>"You'd better get off the track," Randy told him. "There's a train coming."</p>
<p>Much of the rest of the day is a jumble of memories. A woman helping him into the back of Joe Brantner's station wagon. His dad and his grandpa meeting him at the hospital.</p>
<p>Someone washing his dirty face with a dripping wet washcloth. His mom crying when he got home a few hours later, virtually unscathed.</p>
<p>His real concern in the immediate aftermath: He had lost his wrapping paper.</p>
<p>Don't worry about it, his relieved mother told him.</p>
<p>As with many of the generation who had lived through the Depression and World War II, the Geisicks didn't talk much about bad things that happened.</p>
<p>When young Randy asked his parents about the accident, he got a simple answer:</p>
<p>A train hit the bus.</p>
<p>One day at his cousin Ronald's home, the boys got into a closet and found a newspaper with photographs of many of the kids who had been on the bus. Randy's picture was there, but he was misidentified as "Ronald Geisick."</p>
<p>"Look," his cousin said, "there's my name."</p>
<p>Just then, Randy's mother appeared.</p>
<p>"Put that back," she said.</p>
<p><b>No burning questions</b></p>
<p>With little conversation about the tragedy, it rarely entered Randy's mind as he grew up.</p>
<p>"I don't remember thinking about it," he says.</p>
<p>After high school, he farmed for a time, worked for a construction company and eventually headed to California in 1983.</p>
<p>Since 1994, he has lived in Elk Grove, a few miles south of Sacramento, with his wife, Dottie. He is a project manager for a company that makes fixtures for retail stores.</p>
<p>At 53, he is a soft-spoken, thoughtful man with dark hair tinged gray. He still doesn't know much about the accident. In the past 10 years, he has poked around a little bit on the Internet to see what he could find.</p>
<p>But he's not haunted by any burning questions.</p>
<p>It just didn't affect him that much.</p>
<p>He saw a much greater impact on his parents, who grew more cautious, so protective he sometimes felt smothered.</p>
<p>He remembers the admonitions. Don't get too close to the ditch. Be careful. Don't do this. Don't do that.</p>
<p>When his mother could see him, he didn't dare go high in the air on a swing and jump off, the way his friends did.</p>
<p>As he talks, the unmistakable shriek of a train whistle rises in the distance, coming from the tracks that run a couple blocks away. It doesn't bother him.</p>
<p>"I kinda like it," he says.</p>
<p><b>Happy to be alive</b></p>
<p>Alan Stromberger was 11 on that wintry December day when he took a seat near the front of the bus.</p>
<p>He awoke on the ground, crawling among the scattered papers and debris, unable to walk because his back was broken.</p>
<p>A county dump-truck driver picked him up and put him in the front seat of his rig, by the heater, so he could warm up.</p>
<p>The next thing he knew, he was in someone's car, racing to the hospital.</p>
<p>He spent a month there recovering from several broken vertebrae.</p>
<p>Today, he is a 56-year-old farmer, living in Iliff, about 10 miles from where school bus driver Duane Harms grew up.</p>
<p>Alan thinks about the accident once in a while &mdash; when he sees children stepping onto a school bus, when Dec. 14 rolls around.</p>
<p>And yet, like Randy Geisick, he is not fixated on it.</p>
<p>He considers himself fortunate &mdash; if he saw anything gory that day along the tracks, he does not remember it. He considers himself lucky to be alive. Beyond that, he sees little impact on his life.</p>
<p>"I feel like it really hasn't affected me that much," he says.</p>
<p>His back injury was serious, to be sure. But it was nothing compared with what his little sister went through.</p>
<p><b>Screaming in pain</b></p>
<p>Seven-year-old Debbie Stromberger, Alan's sister, hurried to a seat in the very back of the bus and slipped her galoshes on over her shoes.</p>
<p>Less than 20 minutes later, she was in a fight for her life.</p>
<p>When the fast-moving train plowed into the bus, it sheared off the last few feet, taking four seats with it and the children who sat in them.</p>
<p>Debbie was the only one of those children who survived.</p>
<p>But it was close.</p>
<p>She suffered a severe concussion and a broken leg and hand. Her spleen ruptured. She stopped breathing, and doctors had to perform a tracheotomy to keep her alive.</p>
<p>She endured a grueling recovery, beginning with 10 days in a coma. Doctors weren't sure she would ever get better. She spent a month in the hospital, her leg in traction, and pain clawed at her constantly. It was so bad she'd just scream.</p>
<p>She'd lie in bed and hear the X-ray machine clattering down the hall toward her, and she knew it meant they'd have to move her, and she'd scream some more.</p>
<p>When she finally got home in mid-January, in a body cast, a pin through her leg, she was greeted by the Christmas tree, all dried and shriveled.</p>
<p>She spent the rest of that school year at home, learning from a tutor, feeling overwhelmed by all the gifts and cards that came.</p>
<p>And she got better.</p>
<p>Today, Debbie Stromberger Keiser lives in Wickenburg, Ariz., on a small acreage with her husband, Dale. He is a consultant, specializing in hospital laboratory equipment. She helps with the business.</p>
<p>She is scarred physically &mdash; on her throat where doctors inserted the tracheotomy tube, and on her leg.</p>
<p>People see the scars and ask her what happened.</p>
<p>"Then I'll explain the whole story," she says, "and they'll say, 'That's a really tragic thing.'"</p>
<p>But she has no physical hangover from all the injuries.</p>
<p>"I really don't," she says. "I'm very fortunate. I was so young, hopefully things will hold together pretty good. I really don't have anything that I could say is because of that."</p>
<p>The accident was, she believes, just something that happened &mdash; not the bus driver's fault, not anybody's fault.</p>
<p>"It's not something that really hangs with me, I guess," she says. "I just kind of have gone on."</p>
<p><b>Finding peace</b></p>
<p>Three people, all with a tranquility about a tragic day in their lives.</p>
<p>But for some, peace never came.</p>
