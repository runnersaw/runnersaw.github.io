			<p>Duane Harms decides he wants to write something to sum up his thoughts about that fatal day he drove his school bus onto the crossing.</p>
<p>Something about the 45 years that have since passed. Something that will answer the questions that never go away.</p>
<p>It's a warm evening in Southern California.</p>
<p>He gets out a pencil and a yellow notepad with a blue cover.</p>
<p>He prints very neatly.</p>
<p><i>I was hoping against hope that the bus accident would not be brought up before the public attention. For the most part I wish that it not be done. It's sad that most news on T.V. and newspapers is not good.</i></p>
<p><i>Right after the accident I was in such shock and sadden that I didn't really know what to do. The family and friends had to go through great sorrow and were very burdened, it was a very sad time. I'm really sorry. I just wish that I had offered more condolences, sympathy, thoughts and prayers to all.</i></p>
<p>He starts another paragraph, repeating the sentiment he expressed in 1961, one that fostered respect from many people.</p>
<p><i>I would have been willing to have died in order that one or all could have lived. I would also have been willing to do jail time.</i></p>
<p>He is halfway down the page now.</p>
<p><i>The children were all real good kids. Sometimes at recess when I was at Delta School, I'd join them in playing ball.</i></p>
<p><i>I appreciate all the people that helped in the time of need. Thank you. It's good to hear that some of the people that I knew back then are now successful and doing well.</i></p>
<p><i>Things happen that seem to be unfair. I believe that there is a almighty Lord God up above that all of us can turn to.</i></p>
<p>Only four more blank lines remain. He writes two more sentences.</p>
<p><i>People may wonder how I'm doing now. I'm OK.</i></p>
<p><i>Duane</i></p>
<p><b>Staying close</b></p>
<p>The back door swings open and slams shut.</p>
<p>Children rush in and out. In the corner, a video game squawks.</p>
<p>It is "Third Sunday" at the home of Alice Larson Richardson and her husband, Ron.</p>
<p>Their four grown daughters, Kynda and Rhonda and Tawnya and Melissa, are here.</p>
<p>So are their sons-in-law and their 10 grandchildren.</p>
<p>Alice and Ron began the ritual 10 or 11 years ago, as their children married and had children, and schedules got crazy and getting everyone together got tougher.</p>
<p>So they picked a day, the third Sunday of every month, when none of them would schedule anything else, so they could enjoy a meal and each other.</p>
<p>"Too many people lose touch with their kids after they get married," Alice says in a moment of quiet amid the din of a house full of people.</p>
<p>"And they don't know their grandkids all that well."</p>
<p>For Alice, this gathering is partly a legacy of the accident of Dec. 14, 1961, that took her little brother, Steve.</p>
<p>She knows that every day with the people she loves is a gift.</p>
<p>Part of it is an effort to recapture Sundays at her grandmother's house, where she and her cousins played outside while the grown-ups sat for hours around the dining room table, eating, telling stories, laughing.</p>
<p>By 3 o'clock on this afternoon, empty plates and leftover pizza and lasagna cover the table. The kids are outside playing.</p>
<p>Kynda, a nurse, has gone home to get some sleep before her night shift at the hospital.</p>
<p>Alice sits at the dining-room table, with Melissa and her husband, Taran; with Tawnya and her husband, Landon; with Rhonda and her husband, Paul.</p>
<p>Alice's husband, a police officer in nearby Kersey, is headed to work. He gives Melissa a quick kiss.</p>
<p>"Bye, Daddy," she says.</p>
<p>"Love you," Ron answers.</p>
<p>As he crosses the room, Melissa says, "Daddy, Taran wants his hug and kiss."</p>
<p>Ron spins around and stops just short of kissing his son-in-law, too. Laughter ricochets off the dining room walls.</p>
<p><b>Fragments</b></p>
<p>Bob Brantner searches his mind, sees snippets of Dec. 14, 1961.</p>
<p>His big green farmhouse teeming with people. His school bus cut in two pieces. Later, the little brass crosses clinging to the caskets that hold his brother and sister.</p>
<p>But he is not fixated on Dec. 14, 1961. Nor on Dec. 14, 1992, the day his wife was found dead, the reason he is in prison.</p>
<p>Instead, he tries to keep busy. He walks in the prison yard, writes letters, studies the law.</p>
<p>He has an appeal pending that he hopes could mean a reduced sentence and, perhaps, a chance to take care of his ailing mother in Greeley. And he teaches, helping inmates get their general equivalency diplomas.</p>
<p>On a bright afternoon, on the second floor of the administrative building at the Four Mile Correctional Center near Ca&ntilde;on City, he looks out a big window.</p>
<p>Past the tall fence and sharp wire, past the parking lot, he points to the white cinderblock barn and cattle pens of a dairy that supplies prisons and schools with milk.</p>
<p>"It goes from there," he says, pointing to the last row of fences to the east, "all the way up to there," pointing to a road to the west.</p>
<p>"Over there, you've got your heifers and calves," he says.</p>
<p>"There, you've got your dairy cows.</p>
<p>"It's about 1,800 head."</p>
<p>For a moment, he is not inmate No. 83609, waiting for the state appeals court to consider his latest motion, waiting for September 2009, the first time he could be considered for parole.</p>
<p>For a moment, he's got the smell of feed and manure in his nostrils, the feel of the farm in his veins. For a moment, he is home.</p>
<p><b>Familiar scene</b></p>
<p>On a Saturday afternoon, Heath, Nic and Jarrod Ford and a bunch of their friends head out into the pasture.</p>
<p>They're home, taking a break from the rodeo circuit that keeps them on the road hundreds of nights a year. They're on the same farm where their fathers, Glen and Bruce Ford, grew up.</p>
<p>Where their Uncle Jimmy lived until his death on Dec. 14, 1961.</p>
<p>They're doing the same thing that the earlier generation of Ford boys did.</p>
<p>They're playing ball. It's nothing fancy. Bricks for bases. Worked-over bats. Someone wears a very old five-finger fielder's glove with the name Jimmy Ford printed in the leather on the thumb. About the only thing that's new is the ball.</p>
<p>They play for hours, just like their dad and their uncles did.</p>
<p>Though none of them knew their Uncle Jimmy &mdash; he died 16 years before the oldest, Heath, was even born &mdash; they feel close to him in some way that's hard to explain.</p>
<p>They grew up with the stories about Jimmy.</p>
<p>They know about his antics, about the stuff he'd throw at his brothers if they tried to quit a baseball game before he was ready.</p>
<p>Over the years, they've played ball and thought about him.</p>
<p>The day after this game, Heath decides to drive up to Linn Grove Cemetery to pay his respects to his grandfather and his uncle.</p>
<p>He walks up to Jimmy's grave, a new baseball in his hand, scuffed in a few places from the game the day before.</p>
<p>He sets the ball down on Jimmy's headstone, the one with the horse and the Bible chiseled into it.</p>
<p>He walks away.</p>
<p><b>In memoriam</b></p>
<p>In the first week of April 1963, a road crew went to work with bulldozers and graders out near the crossing.</p>
<p>First, they cut a new road along the south side of the tracks, on farmland that once belonged to the Brantner family.</p>
<p>Then they ripped out the old crossing.</p>
<p>Where the old road had approached the tracks at a sharp angle, they pounded seven metal fence posts into the ground, strung barbed wire across them and hung up a "road closed" sign.</p>
<p>When they were done, the crossing was gone.</p>
<p>Later that fall, a new elementary school opened on East 20th Street, a few blocks from the Delta school where the bus was going on that snowy Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Weld County School District 6 officials were determined to pay tribute to the 20 children who died.</p>
<p>They called it East Memorial Elementary School. They hung a simple bronze memorial in the main hallway.</p>
<p>They dedicated the school on Feb. 9, 1964, with a string quartet from Meeker Junior High performing Bach and the families of 14 of the dead children on hand.</p>
<p>That school, and that plaque, and a red leaf maple tree planted outside remain the only permanent public memorials to the children.</p>
<p>Out at the crossing, a brown and brittle wreath, left in December on the 45th anniversary of the accident, dangles from a fence post, near a couple of sprays of flowers and two poems.</p>
<p>Nothing else marks the spot.</p>
